|  "covering" an area means:                                                  |
|    killing all mobs (except those with pickpocket higher than 50, sorry)    |
|    watching those mobs respawn                                              |
|      sometimes I would kill on tylerbeg and watch the respawn with loggy    |
|    picking up all items                                                     |
|    watching those items respawn (world totals are low, assume normally      |
|      around 40 people if on w2 and 5 people if on any other world)          |
|    interracting with world objects in obvious ways (if it's a quest         |
|      object, use quest items on it; use all right click options)            |
|    talking with npcs enough to know where they are on their branch          |
|      (although I think I slacked on this, I was sleep deprived, sorry)      |
|                                                                             |

|  The areas that I failed to cover post "quest cape" are:                    |
|    part of taverly dungeon, past the black demons                           |
|      My character wasn't strong enough to power through them and get the    |
|      spawns. I'm thinking that these spawns are definitely well documented  |
|      though, due to bots in the area killing the dragons. I may have got    |
|      at least 2 black demon spawns during scorpion catcher quest.           |
|    the lava maze dungeon (underground)                                      |
|      I only managed to kill a couple spiders in here.                       |
|      Maybe if I came back with prayer potions I could have got the black    |
|      dragons, but we ran out of time.                                       |
|    the kharidian desert                                                     |
|      I did "comb the desert" to at least collect ground scatter and the     |
|      spawned mobs, but due to their long wandering distances, and how many  |
|      there were, I couldn't document their spawn locations.                 |
|    the kharazi jungle and south karamja broadly                             |
|      This area really upset me during the Shilo village quest, and I        |
|      believe you may find many of the spawn locations in and around that    |
|      recording. The kharazi jungle, I would be surprised if I got every     |
|      mob. Should be helpful though, I know I got at least a few.            |
|    the yanille agility dungeon                                              |
|      Sorry, but I end with 52 agility, so I only get part of this dungeon   |
|    melzar's maze                                                            |
|    west ardougne                                                            |
|      Except for the rat spawns, I think I documented                        |
|      this very well post biohazard quest.                                   |
|    the underground pass                                                     |
|      I documented it acceptably I think "after killing iban but before      |
|      finishing the quest", but didn't get all spawn locations.              |
|    shilo village is sloppy                                                  |
|      but combine all my recordings, and it's documented...                  |
|                                                                             |

|                                                                             |
|  Everywhere else I think is documented thoroughly.                          |
|                                                                             |
|  The good news is that almost all the data collected in this archive        |
|  was already collected well over a decade ago. These replays really         |
|  only serve as a "more complete" recording than a summarized table of       |
|  scraped data. They can also be used to help confirm previous data, or in   |
|  (probably) rare cases, update old data that Jagex had changed since the    |
|  old data was collected.                                                    |
|                                                                             |
|  And of course, where I failed to collect something, others succeeded.      |
|  If the information you want isn't here, it's very possible that someone    |
|  else got it. I know that all quests in RSC were documented in this same    |
|  RSC+ format. For fear of missing someone, I won't mention names, but this  |
|  has really been a huge community effort and I'm deeply appreciative to     |
|  everyone who contributed to it. These past few months of working together  |
|  with the RS1 community to preserve the game have been very special to me.  |
|                                                                             |
|  Thanks to the Jagex team of 2000 to 2004 for making the game that sparked  |
|  my interest in computing and eventually programming.                       |
|                                                                             |
|  And a very big thanks to ornox#1337.                                       |
|  Without his work on RSC+, no replays would have been possible at all.      |
|                                                                             |
