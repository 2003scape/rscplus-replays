This folder shouldn't have any data that isn't unzipped in the parent folder of this directory.
It's included in this archive because these were apparently the recordings interesting enough that
someone wanted me to zip them for easy downloading, while the game was still up (or shortly after).

You may safely delete this directory without losing any recordings. 

Or keep it on your hard drive until it fills up,
so you have easy data to delete if the disk becomes full. ;)
You're welcome!
